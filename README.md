## 📝 Abstract

The automation of the manufacturing process for printed circuit boards (PCBs) requires **high-accuracy PCB inspections**, which depend on the **quality of captured images**.  
Low-quality images can significantly reduce inspection accuracy.

This study proposes a method that combines a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and a **Laplacian Filter** to enhance defect detection in PCB images.  
Our approach achieves:
- **+11.87% improvement** in classification accuracy of PCB images compared to existing methods.
- **+5.2% improvement** on images of other computer components when compared to CNN-only methods.
