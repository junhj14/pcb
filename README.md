📝 Abstract
The automation of the manufacturing process for printed circuit boards (PCBs) requires high-accuracy PCB inspections, which depend on the quality of captured images. Low-quality images can significantly reduce inspection accuracy.

This work proposes a method combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Laplacian Filter to enhance defect detection. The proposed method improves the classification accuracy of PCB images (normal vs. defective) by 11.87% compared to existing methods. Moreover, when applied to images of other computer components, our method shows a 5.2% increase in classification accuracy over CNN-only approaches.

🚀 Highlights
✅ Combination of CNN and Laplacian Filter for defect detection
✅ 11.87% improvement in PCB image classification accuracy
✅ 5.2% improvement on non-PCB computer component images
✅ Suitable for industrial manufacturing automation processes
